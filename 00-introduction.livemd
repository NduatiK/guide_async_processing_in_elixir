## What Are We Talking About

Asynchronous processing in Elixir. Elixir has fantastic support for async computations and parallel data processing.

### Asynchronous Computation

We refer to **asynchronous computation** as computation that doesn't happen in the root process of the program you're running. Sometimes, this computation happens *concurrently*, while sometimes it happens *in parallel*.

### Concurrent or Parallel?

Most often, these are the definitions of these two concepts:

* A program is **concurrent** if it executes different computations interleaved with each other
* A program is **parallel** if those computations happen *at the same time*
